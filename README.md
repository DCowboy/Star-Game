# Star-Game
#### (Working Title)
This is a project I am working on to get past the confidence cliff.

I would appreciate advice on how to improve more than changes made for me. 
So, unless you are using this for your own use, please offer advice instead.

### If the game will not load for play or edit. 
This game may use things that some computers cannot handle. It would be invaluable to me to know about this and what things do and don't work on. If this happens. I would really appreciate it if you posted about it in https://github.com/DCowboy/Star-Game/issues/24. The issue asks for basic system information on the computer that ran the attempt. However, feel free to add any other pertinant info that isn't identifying.

### Current Game Controls
- Turn by mouse: Your ship will always face your mouse pointer and that is the direction you will accelerate in.
- 'a' = accelerate: Pressing this button will cause your ship to accelerate in the direction it is facing. Will not work if shield is up.
- 'd' = inertial dampener: This will cause your ship to slow down, regardless of direction your ship is facing.
- 'space' or Right Mouse Button = fire: Fire your weapon, if the shield is not up.
- 's' = shields: This will put up a barrier to protect your health points, (when they're implemented.) However, engines and weapons will not work while the shield is up; inertial dampener does though.
- 'q' = missions menu: opens up the missions (also opens by clicking tab)
- 'r' = radar: opens up radar tab to expose mini-map (also opens by clicking tab)
- 'e' = status: opens up status tab to expose equipment information (also opens by clicking tab)
- 'c' = cargo: opens up cargo hold tab to expose cargo hold (items holding) (also opens by clicking tab)

These are subject to change, so refer here if in doubt.
