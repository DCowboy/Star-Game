# Star-Game
#### (Working Title)
This is a project I am working on to get past the confidence cliff.

I would appreciate advice on how to improve more than changes made for me. 
So, unless you are using this for your own use, please offer advice instead.

##ToDo:
####On GitHub:
- [x] Improve README file.
- [ ] Improve README file more.
- [ ] Create attribution text for artwork and other open things that I use. (started)
- [ ] Get used to GitHub better and properly organize this repository. (in progress)
- [ ] Whatever else I have not thought of yet. (suggestions would be welcome)

####On Project:
- [x] Finish map illusion
- [x] Add player sub-sprites
- [x] Create and implement other objects (like asteriods to start)
- [ ] Create propper GUI
- [ ] Anything else that will make me feel satisfied with the project's first stage. (suggestions welcome)
