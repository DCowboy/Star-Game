#### (Working Title)
This is a project I am working on to get past the confidence cliff.

I would appreciate advice on how to improve more than changes made for me, 
so, unless you are using this for your own use. please offer advice instead.

##ToDo:
####On GitHub:
- [x] Improve README file.
- [ ] Improve README file more.
- [ ] Create attribution text for artwork and other open things that I use.
- [ ] Get used to GitHub better and properly organize this repository.
- [ ] Whatever else I have not thought of yet.

####On Project:
- [ ] Finish map illusion
- [ ] Add player sub-sprites
- [ ] Create and implement other objects (like asteriods to start)
- [ ] Create propper GUI
- [ ] Anything else that will make me feel satisfied with the project's first stage.
